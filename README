Welcome to Lesa's DWClient (Discworld MUD client).

The code has been carefully written to ensure that none of the MUD's rules are violated.
i.e. there are no triggers or automatic actions, and commands are only sent to the mud
in response to an action by the user.

### How to Run

The easiest way to run the client is to use the launch scripts provided in the root folder or download a pre-packaged release:

1.  **Download the latest release**: Go to the "Releases" section on GitHub and download the `DWClient-<version>.zip` file.
2.  **Unzip**: Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder.
3.  **Configure**: Open the `config.json` file in a text editor to customize it with your character details, passwords, and other preferences.
4.  **Run the script for your OS**:
    - **Windows**: Double-click `run-windows.bat`.
    - **macOS**: Double-click `run-mac.command`.
    - **Linux**: Run `./run-linux.sh`.

These scripts will automatically launch the application using the local `config.json`. If you are building from source, the scripts will also attempt to build the application (requires Maven and Java 17).

Alternatively, you can download IntelliJ IDEA (Free edition). Clone this Github repository from the splash screen, select the "Main" run config at the top right, and click the run or debug button.

### Configuration

The `config.json` file is included in the release ZIP. You should modify it to customize the client to your liking.

Edit the `config.json` to add your characters' password, and the password can be sent by choosing
Menu -> Send Password, or by typing the 'pw' command.

You can also configure per-character teleports. These will be used automatically while speedwalking.
You can temporarily disable use of teleports for speedwalking with the "mm notp" command. Re-enable
them with the "mm tp" command.

Delivery Writ helper is coded. Reading a writ from Mr. Werks will auto-generate some menus to help
you complete the writ.

Some commands:

mm npc <npc name>
mm item <item name>
mm item <number> (to choose one of the matching items - or just navigate the R# menu)
mm loc <room name>
mm route <number> (or just navigate the R# menu)
read writ (this will autocreate W# menus for delivery writs)
