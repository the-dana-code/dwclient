Welcome to Lesa's Discworld MUD client.

The code has been carefully written to ensure that none of the MUD's rules are violated.
i.e. there are no triggers or automatic actions, and commands are only sent to the mud
in response to an action by the user.

The easiest way to run the client is to download IntelliJ IDEA (Free edition). Clone this
Github repository from the splash screen, select the "Main" run config at the top right, and
click the run or debug button.

If config.json doesn't exist, it will be created on first run.

Edit the config.json to add your characters' password, and the password can be send by choosing
Menu -> Send Password, or by typing the 'pw' command.

You can also configure per-character teleports. These will be used automatically while speedwalking.
You can temporarily disable use of teleports for speedwalking with the "mm notp" command. Re-enable
them with the "mm tp" command.

Delivery Writ helper is coded. Reading a writ from Mr. Werks will auto-generate some menus to help
you complete the writ.

Some commands:

mm npc <npc name>
mm item <item name>
mm item <number> (to choose one of the matching items - or just navigate the R# menu)
mm loc <room name>
mm route <number> (or just navigate the R# menu)
read writ (this will autocreate W# menus for delivery writs)

Send feedback to Lesa via tell or mudmail

Enjoy!
