=========================================
v4.95 Cow Bar Update, November 2nd 2024:
=========================================
* New map file created for the new Skund Hedge Wizzard guild, with new locations, NPCs, items etc. now handled (be sure to also update your mindspace plugin to handle the new spells, too!).
* On closing MUSHclient (or just the CowBar plugin), the CowBar will now try to automatically force-flush MUSHclient's cached IPs for connections, to make it easier to reconnect when the MUD's IP/server is changed.  Note that this may make INITIAL connections to the Discworld ever so slightly slower each time, but will help save people from being "stuck" when the server changes IP or similar.  If this feature becomes annoying for any reason, or causes issue, I may add an optional command to disable doing it automatically, and add a new command to manually do it with a quick command (previously, the only way to do this is to go through MUSHclient menus to flush IPs).
* Player shops are now named "[player shop]", much like the "[player house]" and "[player club]" rooms.  This lets people find player shops easily anyway - for example with "minimap player shop {am}" to find all player shops in AM, and also covers the fact player shop names change frequently, and it's unfair old names are locked in.
* Various updated or changed combat texts for quirkier/more unique weapons have been added to support the combat stats plugin.
* Minor fixes/tweaks to changed or missing texts for specific priest shields, witch bug shields, and other minor typo changes and corrections.
* Various new and altered items, NPCs, and locations that have had updates through 2024 - anything from updated places (such as new pottery shop), to changed street names, new items, etc. - anything that has either been blogged, or players have reported from bug-replies they've received.  Please do send me mails with any changes you learn about which need updating in the CowBar database!
=========================================
v4.94 Cow Bar Update, January 14th 2024:
=========================================
* The comms/chat window now has two new menu items; "Add a unique colour to capture" and "Stop capturing a unique colour".  If you add a colour (using MUSHclient's colour-picker window, which lets you enter hex values, RGB values, or use colour-sliders), then ANY text incoming from the MUD that matches that colour, will be treated as an incoming tell and so go into your tells/chat window.  The usefulness here is to allow people to capture messages that are otherwise very hard to capture by pattern - you can capture souls, emotes, remotes, and TM messages, for instance.  HOWEVER - you don't want to capture lots of other messages from the mud, so you should aim to ensure your "options colour" lists unique colours for the things you want to capture, first.  It's no good capturing pure-yellow to capture TM messages, if your weather lines are also yellow - you'll get the weather spamming your chat window constantly.  One trick is to set your TM messages to a "near yellow" - by altering, say, the blue RGB value by a single digit, and setting that colour with your mud-side "options colour tm", and capture that now unique colour (it'll still look the same yellow to your eye, but the CowBar will be able to differentiate it from actual pure-yellow colours!).  Please be responsible - if you start causing so much mud text into your tells tabs that you miss actual tells, that's on you!
* New "minimap plugins" command, lists all the (main) plugins Quow has made and released, whether they are installed or not, whether they are enabled (if installed), or not, and clickable links to help files for those with help files, as a way to start unifying plugins and letting users of the portable package find helpfiles for appropriate plugins. (note - the EFF helper plugin has been updated to add a helpfile to it with "eff help", purely for this reason).
* You can now list all your MDT filters per-category (or all uncategorised filters), with "minimap mdt list" or "minimap mdt list <category>".  Using just "minimap mdt list" will list all uncategorised MDT filters (followed by a list of categories you may have), while specifying a category name after the list will list all MDT filters matching that category, to help you quickly find all of your MDT filters of a certain type.
* New "minimap chat <tab name>" command to let you switch to one of your comms-window chat tabs based on it's name, without needing to click on it.  For example "minimap chat all" would switch to the All tab, "minimap chat writs" would switch to the writs tab (if you have it enabled).
* Tweaked the priority of user-made Hotspot timers based on text-triggers, to allow you to set custom triggers based on seeing kill/death lines on NPCs properly.
* Added better handling for NPCs turned into frogs, for the combat module stat tracking/message handling.
* Added support for combat messages from pois, fire pois, Hogswatch puddings, and Hogswatch baubles - these should now highlight/hide/stat-track properly.
* Fixed an issue with reading writs with a full comms buffer (10,000+ messages) briefly blanking your output until you switched/clicked tabs again.
* Old "refer liza" tip for some advice when you enter L-Space, now updated to "refer marya".
* Added various new Hogswatch tree items to the database, and more detailed/exact info on the new windswept ruins/djinn settlement shop items.
=========================================
v4.93 Cow Bar Update, December 11th 2023:
=========================================
* Fixed a bug introduced in 4.92 that could cause errors to spam your screen when trying to delete a hotspot.
* A new toggle option, set with "minimap values", has now been enabled, and should be toggled on by default for most people when you update.  This will show the value of items next to item names, when listing the 'Details' of an NPC, to quickly find good loot (listing all possible items I have ever found/seen on a particular NPC.  (random sidenote - this feature was coded a few years ago, but left disabled and long forgotten - it was intended to be enabled when I felt I had manually 'value'ed enough items - almost every single item on every single NPC should have been 'value'd by me to get exact AM dollar values now, and I saw it recently so finally turned it on!).
=========================================
v4.92 Cow Bar Update, December 07th 2023:
=========================================
* Brand new command, "minimap quote" to get a quote of the mooment, second in importance only to "minimap cow" (which has also been changed to incorporate the new quote system!).  Currently over one hundred!  Remember to "minimap cow" daily, to maintain your semi-randomised happiness. 
* The "hotspots module" (disabled by default on new CowBar installs), has a new option (enabled by default) to enable interaction with the newly updated Missions Helper/Timer plugin (v1.20+) by Quow, and allow the Missions Helper to create temporary timers with short-hand names of missions you have on-cooldown for all missions the plugin supports.  Missions will count DOWN instead of up like normal hotspots, and will appear "first"/at the bottom of your hotspot window.  To enable/disable, right-click the hotspots window and tick/untick the "Accept Mission Helper Timers" option.  NOTE: This will need you to also update the missions helper plugin, to the latest v1.20+ to support this feature.
* The CowBar now supports communicating your guild and your Order - currently this is only used in the newly updated Mindspace helper plugin (v3.10+) to enable it to highlight primary skills in spellcheck outputs, and give more specific stats in it's new "mindspace stats" feature.
* New "minimap modules" command lists all possible modules in the CowBar, and shows their current enabled/disabled status.
* New "minimap mdt test <string>" command to help test your MDT filters and find possible problems, for example try "minimap mdt test scarred mcsweeney nobleman" to check which triggers could match, and in what areas or categories they are in etc.
* The hotspot window will now automatically only show minutes and seconds if you have no timers that are currently above 1 hour - there is also a new option "Show Hours Column" (enabled by default) that can be toggled off, to NEVER show the hours column even if timers are above this, for people setting up very narrow window displays.
* A new "Reverse Hotspot Timer Ordering" option in the Hotspots window right-click menu, disabled by default, can be enabled to reverse your hotspot timers so that the lowest/most recent one is listed first (at the bottom of the window), with the oldest timers listed last (at the top/off the top of the window).  Note that this does not affect the new mission-timers - they will always sort in one way, and appear below all standard hotspot timers.
* A new option "Fixed Burden Colours" is now in the right-click menu of the vitals bar window, in the "Colour Vitals Bar..." sub-menu.  Enabling this will give you two popup windows asking for a low-burden threshold and a high-burden threshold, and will set your burden bar to only ever be your set burden colours - the low/green colour if below the low-threshold, the high/red colour if above the high-threshold, and your medium/yellow colour if inbetween the two, for people who want clear cutoffs of their burden points, rather than a slowly changing gradient colour of the burden bar.  If your low and high threshold are set to the same value, then your burden colour will be treated as a binary - switching only between your "low/green" and your "high/red" colour.
* Recording a new talker channel will try to auto-correct capitalisation errors made for many of the most common talker channels, with a message warning you to be more careful with capitalisation in future (I can't fix capitalisation for every possible club channel etc.!)
* Deleting a chat-tab now correctly switches to the first tab and refreshes the window.
* Minor bug-fixes with handling of clearing older communications-window messages from wrong tabs once the communications buffer limit of 10,000 messages is hit.
* Many changes and additions to the various graphical maps, plus item/location/npc database etc. - I've tried to include all changes that get blogged about (or that people tell me about!), from the new windswept ruins in the Eritian desert to various new items.  Also the Ephebian underdocks map now has small indicators of which rooms can contain the smuggler's treasure room.
====================================
v4.91 Cow Bar Update, May 24th 2023:
====================================
* A new feature to "describe" a location has been added - this will auto-generate a descriptive detail of a given location, trying to explain what part of a map or region it's in, and listing nearby street names and any adjacent shop names, with the intent of generating descriptions for Visually Impaired players, to help locate a place more easily.  
  - Select a specific room (either by clicking "show", or using "minimap <result number>" after a search, or clicking a location on the map), and enter "minimap describe".  Alternatively, you can do "minimap describe <result number>" after a search, or do "minimap describe here" to describe your character's current location.  
* The new Unseen University Octangle has been added, with the UU map updated, the database updated to handle speedwalking into/out of the UU, and handling for the UU library map on entry/exit working with the new update.
* All player houses across the Disc now have their interior room IDs mapped into the database (around 850 new rooms added to the database) - this will allow users to speedwalk somewhere else on the Disc while in any back room of their house, rather than only from the entrance way, and also allow people to bookmark their back rooms for speedwalking into from outside, rather than only the entrance rooms.
* Many new items throughout, plus some new map changes, new rooms, NPCs etc. - basically maintaining all game updates seen through blogs or reported to me from players since the last release. (if you get an idea-rep implemented that doesn't get blogged, let me know of what the change was so I can add it!)
* Route between Nowhere and Death's Domain updated and fixed with appropriate forced journey/walk commands, now that you can journey in those terrains.
* New commands "minimap export layout", "minimap export colours", "minimap import layout <layout string>", "minimap import colours <colour theme string>" have been added, to achieve with commands what was previously only done through the instant layout and colour themes menus, to allow you to more quickly and easily change layouts and colour themes with commands alone, or set client-side systems up to enable you to quickly switch layouts depending on your circumstances.
* Behind-the-scenes support for the new Mindspace v3.0+ plugin, to enable alt-handling and su'ing to different characters and allow the mindspace plugin to keep track of which character you have switched to, for maintaining the new per-alt skills and spells.
* "minimap position" while in the UU Library now also calculates the GP cost to seal a distortion at the depth you are at and tells you.
* "minimap version" command now also shows the date your current CowBar version was last published by me.
* Trying to create a bookmark with "minimap bookmark" (or via the menus) in a room which already has a bookmark, will now say the name of the current bookmark (clickable to rename that bookmark).  You can still list and rename/delete/manage all bookmarks with "minimap bookmarks" command.  Deleting a bookmark will report the name of the deleted bookmark in the output, in case you want to re-add it again after.
* Error-handling added for hotspot, layout, and colour importing, to prevent plugin crashes if you tried to import corrupted strings.
* Shift-clicking on Thursday's Island from the main terrain map will now take you to the island map, rather than generate an error.
* Default colour-theme for new users changed to "Black Patched", from the old default "Basic Cow".
* Dollar value of rivings, for woodworking, in the database are now set to the dollar price of one foot, so quickly see what tier each wood is.  Search for all wood types with "riving of", and the dollar value of each will indicate the tier - $1 for low, $2 for medium, $4 for high, and $6 for very high.  The roughly 20 or so new wood types are all included.
=====================================
v4.90 Cow Bar Update, June 27th 2022:
=====================================
* When you right-click the communications window, if there is a "minimap {x, y, z}" location command detected in the chat line, or a URL/website link (using very simplified URL patterns for speed!), then new menu options will appear at the bottom of the right-click menu, to quickly copy just the minimap command(s), or copy just the URL(s), into your clipboard (separated by " | " if there are multiple in one chat message), for easier pasting into your command window or a browser address window when people send you things.
* A pair of new commands that work together, requested by Umiven, "minimap return" and "minimap repeat", to quickly and easily perform a new speedwalk from wherever you currently are, to either the last place you did a speedwalk from, or the last place you did a speedwalk to;
- "minimap return" will try to perform a new speedwalk instantly from your current location, to the START of the last speedwalk the CowBar created for you.  For example if you speedwalk to the Drum from the Thieves Guild, you could do "minimap return" and go back to the Thieves guild entrance - even if you had walked away from the Drum and gone somewhere else first.
- "minimap repeat" will try to go back to the same location you speedwalked to most recently, from wherever you are currently stood.  For example if you speedwalk to the Drum from the Thieves Guild, and then walked to the post office, you could do "minimap repeat" and go back to the Drum again immediately.  You could then walk somewhere else and do "minimap repeat" and immediately go back to the Drum again.
- Note that performing "return" and "repeat" themselves, will NEVER change the stored "return" and "repeat" points, so you can do as many return and repeat commands as you like from as many different places, and the two points will always be the same two rooms until you actually perform a new speedwalk some other way.
(Remember you can use "mm" instead of "minimap" for quicker commands, if you have enabled "minimap shortcow" first)
* More outgoing backstab moves correctly captured (thanks to Konrad).
* Lots of [room shorts] around Ankh-Morpork have been updated (improved to mention which streets are intersected), the database should now reflect all of the (current) changes - be sure and contact Quow if you find others that have changed and want updating in future!
* Various minor item or room additions/changes added to the database.
======================================
v4.81 Cow Bar Update, April 18th 2022:
======================================
* The "Move Clicked Tab Left/Right" option when right-clicking a chat tab of the communications window should work as expected to help speedily rearrange your chat tabs.
* Some more new items, re-namings of short room names in AM.
* Some new combat messages for a new item.
======================================
v4.80 Cow Bar Update, April 10th 2022:
======================================
* New option "TPA Status Colours" added to the group and shields window, disabled by default.  Enabling will cause it to sometimes colour the "TPA" status in the bars based on what colour of TPA change is seen (from the regular/current grey when invisible, changing through dark red, bright red, bright orange, bright yellow when almost broken).
 - Note the colours of the text don't match the "status" of shield (eg they don't go dull red, bright red, orange, yellow) - partly as these colours do not stand out on the HP/GP bars, and partly at a quick glance they don't reflect "danger levels" - instead they go from white (invisible), through to pale yellow, yellow, orange, and red (for danger!) when nearly broken, and black when broken/no TPA as usual.
* Various new locations, items, NPCs added throughout the Disc, including new playermade items and crafts, plus many various minor changes and tweaks that have been made to items over that time, all incorporated to the databases/maps etc. (thanks to players who have kept me informed with results of their own idea/bug reps, as well as the more in-depth "changelog" style blogs we now get, making this far easier, and in fact at all possible).
* Yet more minor (and previously missing) generally obscure combat messages supported by the combat handler.
=========================================
v4.71 Cow Bar Update, November 07th 2021:
=========================================
* New "minimap show <result>" command added, does the equivalent of clicking the "Show" link on search results, to show the result on the graphical map (centre the map and act as clicking on the room, so a followup "minimap details" or "minimap route" command will show room details/try to speedwalk to it).
* Some more support for recording absorb stats on the new updated and varied priest shield names (still many missing, I will update these as they are learned!).
* Various minor updates and additions to the databases and graphical maps for items/stables/locations/NPCs etc.
=====================================
v4.70 Cow Bar Update, July 30th 2021:
=====================================
* Road network all across the northern sto-plains, all the way up to and including Leggit Loop, has been journeyed through both ways and put into the database and linked to terrain maps and pathfinding routes, along with "quickfind lookups" for places like Quirm Pseudopolis, Rham-Nitz and similar "not-in-the-game" locations.  You may find long journeys between northern AM and Ramtops-regions might take you down different roads than you are used to - this is a good thing - the pathfinding always finds the shortest possible route, from the known locations in the database!

* New tentative-test feature - in the "Instant Layouts" menu, there is a new sub-menu at the top, for special graphical layouts - I may slowly expand this with any particularly interesting layouts anyone shares with me (send me the background and the "scaled export" text), or I come up with - as a quick and easy way for people to try out some more... diverse... layouts, complete with graphical backgrounds.  Currently "The Turtle Moves" is there.  Note that this requires associated background images, which will be distributed with all packages in the /maps/ folder, named as "layout_<name>.png" - for example "layout_turtle.png".  If you switch to one of these special layouts, and then want to change back to any other layout after, you will have to clear the background image if you no longer want it visible - either from right-clicking the graphical map, going to the "Colour Theme..." sub-menu and selecting "Background - Clear Image" at the bottom, or from a new clickable link that will appear whenever the CowBar detects you switching themes with a background image set, that will allow you to quickly and instantly "clear" any current background image to blank.  For a preview of the Turtle Moves layout, see here:  https://i.imgur.com/17xnvcC.jpg

=====================================
v4.61 Cow Bar Update, June 24th 2021:
=====================================
* Fix for errors on brand new users running for the first time.
* Stables in Klatchian trading post.
* Minor database updates/additions.
====================================
v4.6 Cow Bar Update, June 24th 2021:
====================================
* New option (ENABLED by default) to make group-chat matching (for capturing group messages to the chat window, for instance) try to ignore any messages that don't match your known group name (matched/discovered when you first join a group).  Right-click the chat window and disable "Group Name Filtering" if you want the window to continue to capture all messages that start with "[<text>]".  This will help stop capturing things like people's [x] plans in finger info and such.  The plugin MUST see you join a group to know what your group name is, since the last time the plugin loaded. If it doesn't know your group name, it will continue to allow all [messages] through unfiltered for safety.
* New option (DISABLED by default) to auto-reset XP-rates and graphs when detecting you switching to different characters.  Option can be switched by right-clicking the XP window and unticking/ticking it.
* New command "minimap statsclipboard" and "minimap statsclipboard <set number or name>" will do the same output as the "minimap stats" except, EXCEPT instead of outputting it to your screen, it outputs it direct into your clipboard, for you to "paste" elsewhere.
* New command "minimap xp report" outputs current XP report to your output, the same as right-clicking the XP graph window and selecting "Show XP Report".
* Thousands more exact balance weights, item values, and general full item information added throughout the database - with a huge focus on getting 99% of every armour, weapon, clothing, and jewellery exact and precise values in.  "minimap cowstats" can show you these stats, which now sit at;
* Total Rooms: 17162
  - Indoors: 6027
  - Outdoors: 11135
  - Room Connections: 34167
* Total Shops: 1105
  - Shop Listings: 14248
* Total NPCs: 2851
  - NPC Inventory Items: 16788
  - NPC Sale Items: 947
* Total Items: 10495
  - Item Appraise Data: 9023
  - Item Weight Data: 9008
    (precise weights: 6717)
  - Item Exact $ Value: 6606
=====================================
v4.5 Cow Bar Update, April 25th 2021:
=====================================
* New command "minimap shortcow" toggles on or off the "mm" alias, this allows you to just enter "mm" instead of "minimap" for the text commands, for example "mm drum" or "mm routenpc 3".  This can also be toggled in the main graphical minimap right-click menu.
* From version 4.5 onwards, the full combat stats for dodge, parry, and block, will now start recording "expertly" defenses separately from "deftly" results (rather than grouping them both together as "good"), and both will be visible when you generate a full stat report, by right-clicking your combat stats window.  Note that all previous stats will be classed as "deftly", and so you will need to reset your combat stats/create a new stat set, if you want to see a clear, updated separation in future.
* New command "minimap statsets" (plural) lists all combat stat sets you have, with clickable links to quickly change, and a note by your currently selected set.
* New command "minimap stats" generates the full combat stat report for the current stat set.
* Combat stats will now list an "Other" section at the end of all defense types, if there are any "other" stats to report - this can cover anything not specifically captured, such as a skeleton warrior defending you from attack.
* "minimap stats <number/name>" generates the full combat stat report of the numbered or named stat set (without you needing to switch to it, first).
* Command "minimap statset <set number/name>" has been RENAMED, and is now "minimap switchset <set number/name>" to switch to another combat stat set.
* New command "minimap cowstats" shows you some vital stats on the CowBar database, some counts of all the rooms, connections, NPCs, items, and item data Quow has gathered/kept updated.
* New command "minimap crosshair" toggles the centre-market on the map between a crosshair and a central box - the same as could already be doing in the menus (minimap options).
* "Recognised Room Exits" listed when bringing up a room's info are now clickable, to show the connected direction's room info (which you can then click on directions from further and further, "navigating" through room infos).  A new command "minimap exit <exit direction>" or "minimap go <exit direction>", will emulate this clicking (selecting the room connected via the exit as if you had left-clicked it on the map, and spitting out the newly selected room's info which you can then navigate further from).  This would allow you to, for example, with the above shortalias enabled, do in sequence;  "mm job market", "mm 1", "mm go w", "mm go n", "mm go nw", "mm go e", "mm route" and you would start speedwalking into Woo Hun Ling's.
* When queueing many movement commands in a row (with the map showing its predicting of where it thinks you will end up) - if it detects you ending up somewhere unexpected part way through (eg because you entered a portal/passage/teleport or similar things part way through your queued movements), it now instantly clears any further predictions and just shows your live position as a fallback (this should help situations like queueing movements which include portal/passage/teleports in the middle of them).
* Queued "l" and "g" commands (ONLY those two, not aliases or full-typed "look"/"glance") in the middle of a long queue of movements will no longer confuse the minimap and make it think you moved the next predicted move of a long-chain when those looks/glances are sent back from the mud (making long movement queues more accurate if you happen to throw in an "l" or "g" in the middle of the queue).
* Tweaks to the "follow handler" (handling when the Cow Bar sees you "follow"ing somebody else to another room), particuarly when you already have a queue of your own movements running.
* You can now disable or enable a hotspot, in the hotspots window.  A disabled hotspot will not be displayed, and not send any timer notifications or be active - but you can re-enable it again in the future, rather than have to delete and re-create ones you don't always want to use.  Right click the hotspots window and look for the new menu options to do so.  (if you have never seen the hotspots window - right click the main graphical minimap, go to "Disable/Enable Modules..." sub-menu, and enable the hotspots module, and give it a try!)
* "MDT Shoutout" - when modifying an MDT filter match, you can now set it to "Shoutout" - this is TEMPORARY - it will not save between plugin loads, the intention is to be used for things like help finding named NPCs for Genua Coffee Nostra missions and similar when searching for something specific (warning - this can be very spammy, don't use it for regular hunting NPCs!).
* Fixes for "absorb" vs "absorbs" changed mud texts for some shield-related messages in combat triggers.
* "minimap gpregen <0-6>" command - you can now set your GP regen (client-side) up to 6, rather than a maximum of 5, when using the command.
* "minimap shieldsounds group" and "minimap shieldsounds solo" commands have been added, they will toggle all current group, or self (solo) sounds, off or on (just toggle each to the reverse of each one's current state).
* Many more missing weapon text additions/supports for various previously missing combat triggers, weapons, horses, things defending other things, etc.
* Many graphical map file updates and fixes throughout (tweaks, fixes, updates, additions) - majority of map files had at least one change/improvement.
* Passage rooms all have their own (joint) map, just to show you are in a midway passage room, for those idling there/left there feeling lost and confused.
* Many, many more updates, additions, fixes etc. to the databases for rooms, NPCs, items, inventories, shops, etc. - literally thousands of records have been updated.

=========================================
v4.42 Cow Bar Update, November 22nd 2020:
=========================================
* Addition of "minimap version" command.
* Some minor combat weapon message fixes.
* New shop in Sto-Lat.
* Corrected river carriage stop on AM map.
* Ability to specify 10-90% threshold for HP loss notification sounds.
* Many new items, hidden locations, more data entry, accurate weights and values, and much more, throughout the databases.
=====================================
v4.41 Cow Bar Update, July 17th 2020:
=====================================
* New AM Fool's Guild map and database entries.
* Over 10,000 items now in the item database.
* Don't have a "cow".
=====================================
v4.40 Cow Bar Update, July 06th 2020:
=====================================
* Added two new text commands, mostly for screenreader users, "minimap shieldsounds enable" and "minimap shieldsounds disable", to either enable, or disable, each and every supported self and group shield break sound effect that the Cow Bar supports in a single command.
* Added "minimap time" command for screenreader users to also be able to see the predicted discworld date/time from your system clock.
* Added "minimap hotspotsreset" command to reset ALL your current hotspots to 0 at once, without any confirmation needed.
* The "Optimise Combat Colours" option (from right-clicking the combat stats window) now has the ability to set a specific exact colour - you should try to pick a UNIQUE colour that nothing else in your Discworld colours uses, and set your combat colour for all alts to this colour, and tick the optimise tick-box.  This will prevent the plugin from trying to apply combat triggers to non-combat lines, and optimise the plugin for all non-combat lines sent from the mud.
* Added exception handling for hotspot timer messages (stop a MUSHclient race condition crashing out when sending a hotspot notification at the exact millisecond text from MUD comes in).
* Fixed the "minimap statcreate <name>" command to properly generate a brand new statset on issuing.
* Fixed broken speedwalk into/out of barbarian winter camp when personal travel options set to journey (thanks Camelion).
* Support for a few more missing combat messages.
* Many more various item/room/NPC data additions and updates.  Current counts at;
 - 9910 items;
    8691 with full descriptions
    8042 with full appraise info
    7659 with weights
 - 2766 NPCs
    16515 records of NPC items/inventories
 - 16956 rooms 
    33887 direction-connections
    13622 shop inventory items
====================================
v4.30 Cow Bar Update, May 05th 2020:
====================================
* New command "minimap screenreader" will toggle screenreader mode on or off, when on this will change the output of a number of commands such as bookmark lists and search results to be simpler for screenreader users.  This is a work in progress, other improvements may be made in future for screenreader users in this mode.
* New "Instant Layout" added, "Minimoolist", that hides all windows and disables all margins, leaving only the graphical map window on-screen, which sits out of the way in the top-right corner by default.
* A number of new commands have been added to control features without using the mouse and to help screenreader users;
- "minimap renamelast <new name>" command to rename the last created bookmark to a new name.
- "minimap bookmarkdelete <ID number>" command to delete numbered bookmark listed in 'minimap bookmarks' list.
- "minimap bookmarkrename <ID> <new name>" command to rename numbered bookmark in 'minimap bookmarks' list with this new name.
- "minimap roominfo <result number>" to show room details of a specified search result (can also just do "minimap <number>")
- "minimap npcinfo <result number>" to show NPC details of a specified NPC result (can also just do "minimap npc <number>")
- "minimap iteminfo <result number>" to show item details of a specified item result (can also just do "minimap item <number>")
- "minimap omitmap" to try and get the CowBar to omit or show the ascii map if it's still being sent by the MUD.
- "minimap position" to tell you your current position, including your thaum-depth, row, and column count in the UU Library.
* Right-clicking on a chat-tab in the chat window now allows you to move the selected chat tab left, or right (swapping places with adjacent tabs), to help re-organising your chat tabs without having to delete/rename/edit them.
* New "beach hut" location and minor map added between Holywood and Ankh-Morpork with speedwalk routes added.
* New shorter speedwalks added from Oolskunrahod carriage stops to the nearby barbarian camp.
* 'minimap shop "<item>"' can now have quotes around the item name for exact-match only, similar to the 'minimap item "<name>"', eg;  minimap shop "carrot"  or  minimap item "carrot"  to only find carrots, not carrot cakes.
* Many various database additions (NPCs, inventories, items, weights etc.) throughout.
* Combat texts and XP/HP/GP notification texts no longer force a black background colour, for people with custom background colours.
* Most terrain NPCs have been moved to the terrain maps, with various missing data added and some splits between Ram and Sto equivalents where inventories often differ.
========================================
v4.21 Cow Bar Update, January 13th 2020:
========================================
* Added support for combat messages for the new tentacle-arm weapon, and the seafoam whip.
========================================
v4.20 Cow Bar Update, January 03rd 2020:
========================================
* Update supports the SS Unsinkable boat misions, including the new items, a map of the boat showing your position, the written-map supporting the boat directions when on-board, and other essentials!
=========================================
v4.10 Cow Bar Update, November 20th 2019:
=========================================
* Fixed error message occurring on login for some players relating to internal MUSH timestamps and GMCP values (hopefully all of them...)
* Find items unique/exclusive to that shop - any time you right click the graphical minimap, under "Show clicked room info" is a new menu item (*IF* that room sells items) "Shop shop uniques".  It will search that shop's inventory and only list items that cannot be found in any other shop nor from any NPC (mostly for listing Shonky-uniques, currently at 192 and growing).
* Many many updates and filling out of data to the room, item & NPC databases:
 - 9584 items;
    8363 with full descriptions
    7717 with full appraise info
    7241 with weights
 - 2720 NPCs
    16329 records of NPC items/inventories
 - 16798 rooms 
    33607 direction-connections
    13523 shop inventory items
=====================================
v4.07 Cow Bar Update, July 03rd 2019:
=====================================
* Added "Mail Carriage" route markings to graphical maps (AM Post Office, Sto-Lat, Sto-Plains, Ramtops, Uberwald).
* When hiding the main graphical minimap window, if using the "Click Here" link to show it again (rather than "minimap show"), the map no longer freezes up.
* Ability to use the CowBar "pre-release" versions of MUSHclient for testers, without causing errors.
* If you have v5.07+ of MUSHclient (not officially released yet), an option is added to the Theme-Colour sub-menus to let you customise the "background" colour - this is the colour MUSHclient shows BEHIND the world window, if you don't have your world window maximised within MUSHclient.
=====================================
v4.06 Cow Bar Update, June 22nd 2019:
=====================================
* Two more player houses added to Ephebe map & database.
* MDT colour matched filters you create in the written-map window get sorted in the per-room listing before anything else (eg create an MDT colour-match on "red" while having Discworld-side "options colour playername=red", give them a score of 1, they'll be listed first in a room before an imperial guard which might otherwise be worth more MDT-value).  The CowBar will now assume any colour-match filter you create to always be more important than anything else in the room order wise.
* The Vitals Bars (HP, GP, Burden) can now be stacked/displayed one of four ways, set by right-clicking the vitals miniwindow;  "Standard Vertical Bars" (the normal/default vertically-stacked bars). "Standard Horizontal Bars" for wide but short windows (eg stretch bars along bottom of your screen)... and two new ways; "Downwards Bars" and "Upwards Bars" for narrow, but tall, vitals windows, to make the bars either fill/empty towards the bottom of the window, or the top.
* Various misc (minor) additions to the item & NPC database.
=====================================
v4.05 Cow Bar Update, June 12th 2019:
=====================================
* Thursday's Island new graphical map created and added to the databases for tropical island visitors.
* Layout Sharing - in the "Instant Layouts" sub-menu, there are two new options "Import Scaled Layout" and "Export Scaled Layout", these let you share your exact windows layouts and screen margins with any other player, regardless of screen-size or aspect-ratio differences; it will translate the positions/sizes in percentages.  This function is for people who develop new UI backgrounds to exactly fit a specific window structure and layout, so it's easy to share your background image (which will auto-stretch) and your layout (which will also do so now) with anyone else, of any other screen-size.  Note that vastly different screen-sizes/aspect-ratios may end up squashing or stretching windows when translated to other screens.
* You can now go below 50% brightness, down to 20% brightness, with the text command ("minimap brightness <20-100>").  The menu-options are still steps of 10 from 50-100.
* Viewing room details of a shop that can sell many items (the Shonky shop) now respects your "minimap limit" value to cut the amount of entries off.
* "minimap limit <value>" can now be set up to 2000, to list up to 2000 results in searches or shop-lists.
* Z-Order handling of miniwindows has been totally revamped, for people who need or want windows overlayed slightly on top of eachother, but in a specific order.  Clicking any miniwindow once (for the graphical minimap, this must be the titlebar) will bring that window to the top, and re-shuffle other windows downwards from where they were.  This means if you want a specific depth-order of all 9 windows, click them once each in turn, in order from the "bottom" (lowest importance/bottom window first) to "top" (highest importance/top window last).  This window ordering will be saved between restarts, and will also be exported/imported with the instant layout sharing system.
=====================================
v4.04 Cow Bar Update, June 11th 2019:
=====================================
* Fixed issues with the new window-caching causing issues when enabling Show Alignment or changing Vitals bars to stack vertically or not.
* New option on Vitals Bars window to disable gradients on the bars - this causes the HP/GP/Burden coloured bars to be "flat", and not have the gradients out to black on either side.
* New menu option in Vitals Bars colours menu "Colour: Reset Vitals Bars" to reset all of your HP/GP/Burden colours back to the CowBar defaults easily.
=====================================
v4.03 Cow Bar Update, June 11th 2019:
=====================================
* New default colour-theme "Winter Moo" for an almost ice-blue or electric-blue colour theme.
* New custom colour-theme option "Disc-Date Text" added to change the colour of the Disc-Date at the bottom of the graphical minimap window (previously this was always forced-black).
* New custom colour-theme option "XP Rate-Line" added to change the colour of the active plot-lines showing your current XP-Rate on the XP miniwindow graph (previously this was always forced-green).
* The line separating the Discworld Date with the graphical minimap will match the new "Disc-Date Text" colour (previously this was always forced-black).
* The XP scale lines of the XP Miniwindow Graph now match your theme's "Miniwindow Borders" colour (previously this was always matched to your "Texts-General" colour, which the plot-point numbers are drawn in).
* Third party vs third party specials (fail and success) messages are now correctly coloured/not-coloured/hidden based on your combat-stats preferences.  These are specials between two other people that don't involve you.
====================================
v4.02 Cow Bar Update, June 10th 2019:
====================================
* The sub-menu to customise all the colours of your current theme has been replaced with a single "Customise Current Theme" button that opens a listbox, asking you which colour you want to change.  This is to get around MUSHclient's artificial limit of 100 items in a single entire menu before it cuts items off the bottom of the menu.
* The "Text Shadow" custom colour option is now renamed to "Vitals Text Shadows" and will affect the text-shadowing/highlighting of the vitals bars numbers.
========================================
v4.01 Cow Bar (same-day update to v4.0):
========================================
* You can change the font used for the Discworld Date beneath the minimap in the Colour Themes menu of the graphical minimap window.
* "Active Tab Back" added as a custom-colour option to the custom colour menus, for changing the background of "active" (selected) chat-tabs in the comms window.  Defaults to the same as "Tab Face Back" on upgrade from previous version.
* Importing colour-themes from others with the import tool, now correctly refreshes all on-screen colours without needing a plugin restart afterwards.
====================================
v4.00 Cow Bar Update, June 09th 2019:
====================================
* New colour theme system - you can now instantly switch the CowBar's colour themes between some default colour-sets, quickly make your own, or import colour themes made by others.  Right-click the main graphical minimap window, go to the new "Colour Theme..." sub-menu and select a theme.  You can pick from the standard "Basic Cow" (default/standard), "Black Patched" (a new dark theme), "Grey Moo" (a fairly dark grey theme), the deliciously fresh "Green Pasture", and a hideously ugly bright white "White Patched" theme that maybe somebody can improve on for us all.  Selecting a colour theme will automatically change and over-ride any current window/text colour settings set throughout the CowBar.
 -- You can now change all individual colours, from the "Customise Theme..." sub-menu - from the texts, to the windows, to the outlines, etc., all quickly and easily, to design your own theme entirely or just to tweak a built-in theme a little.
 -- You can "Export" your custom theme (to share with others/save as backups), and "Import" a pasted theme from somebody else/from backups, with simple clicks.
* Easy background/UI images are now possible - in the new Colour Theme menu is a pair of options to clear, or to set, a background image for the overall MUSHclient screen - this will appear behind all miniwindows and all text output from the MUD.  This is for people who wish to develop a "UI" style graphic overlay with a little creativity, if you space your miniwindows out a bit and fill the blank margin space with a newly design background graphic.
* All miniwindows (outside of the main graphical window) now have a new "Font Change" sub-menu (and the old basic Comms menu font system has been removed), within these menus for each miniwindow are new options; "Font: Pick Font-Type", "Font: Pick Font-Size" and "Font: Restore Default".  You can now change the font of every single window individually, using whatever font type or size you wish to try, and each window will try to handle the changes as appropriate.  
Important Notes: You should pick monospace (fixed-width) fonts for Comms, Written-Map, Ascii-Map, otherwise word-wrapping at the edges of screens and column-formatting for the map will not render correctly, as these features require characters in a font to all be an identical width.  Also not all font-types MUSHclient finds are valid, and not all fonts support all font-sizes, it is best to stick to standard/common fonts!
* New Shades maze map created by Quow, hopefully a bit clearer to follow, and some extra previously missing exits added.
* The old Shades handler has been completely overhauled, modelled on the more recent Medina handler, for a bit more reliability (still needs room descriptions, and you should not try to speedwalk around the Shades!).
* Two new options in the group & shields window in the "Shield Event Alerts..." sub-menu, "Self Shield Chat Alerts" and "Group Shield Chat Alerts" will generate texts into your Comms window (treated as incoming tells) in your colour theme's "red" colour warning of the shield breaks, and giving them timestamps etc.
* Map images are cached after loading as you travel around, speeding up re-visiting maps you have already visited since last reloading MUSHclient/the plugin - this make an especially noticable difference when zipping in and out of the large (and usually slow-to-load) terrain maps and interior maps.
* All personal settings (from your window layouts, your minimap options, everything) has been moved to your user-database file, "_quowmap_userdata.db" in the /maps/folder.  Your settings will be automatically moved from MUSHclient's state file on first-run.  This means that upgrading the full MUSHclient package by over-writing your old folder with the new download won't lose any user-settings at all in the future, and you can easily backup or copy all of your settings (and bookmarks, combat stats etc.) by copying the "_quowmap_userdata.db" file the CowBar creates in the /maps/ folder.
* New text command "minimap statcreate <name>" lets you instantly create (and switch to) a stat set with the chosen name.  Don't forget you can easily switch to already-existing statsets with "minimap statset <name>", and you can see a FULL list of all commands in brief with "minimap commands".
* Comms window menus have been tweaked to help people who have recorded many tens of different club and talker channels - "Stop Recording Talker/Club Channel" is no longer a sub-menu, but brings a selection box choice up of which channel/club you no longer wish the Comms window to record.
* "Screen Margins..." sub-menu is now ONLY found on the main graphical minimap window (the "master window"), though "Instant Layouts..." can still be quickly accessed from all miniwindows.
* Default settings from a brand new install with no user-settings found have been tweaked to match those found in the portable MUSHclient package (for example, defaulting the map to the Drum in AM, defaulting the layout to the "Simple Cows" layout which has no Group/Shields or Hotspots windows, etc.)
* Further optimisations in some miniwindow renderings with core data-caching.
* Various item additions to the databases (more unique items found from Shonky shop searchings etc.).

====================================
v3.90 Cow Bar Update, May 21st 2019:
====================================
* New Fools' Guild in Ankh-Morpork has been added to the AM map, and given it's own new map, with database entries, speedwalks, shortcut links, clickable-links (shift-click on-screen to shift between connecting maps at set points).
* "minimap limit <50-1000>" can now be used to change the limit of the number of search results (eg from appraise searches, or item searches).  Be warned that setting this to 1000 and doing a generic search with so many results can cause some seconds of lag in MUSHclient while it generates so many lines of text at once.  The default limit of 100 is recommended, and the high values allowed are more for temporary situations, for example wanting to find every possible furniture-container in the game for research.
* "minimap commands" will list every user-command available in the plugin, in a simple list (without explanations) of the text commands the plugin supports.  "help minimap" is always a more curated list of more common/useful commands with explanations.
* All new Written-Map/MDT parser, now built-in to the CowBar, updated from the old standalone 2016 version, heavily optimised, with new features and improvements throughout (eg. per-room entity score sorting, colour matchings, multiple categories, map-region limits etc.), and now all easily maintainable from right-click menus by right-clicking the CowBar's "Written Map" window, and stored in your settings file.  No more needing to edit a code-file for the faint-of-heart, and no worries of loss of changes between plugin updates.  You can easily create new scores/highlights of written-map entities, and change any aspect of others.  
 -- The old standalone version of the MDT plugin is now automatically disabled if detected when the CowBar launches, if you had any custom changes/additions to your file, you can now integrate them into the CowBar via the right-click menus on the written map.
 -- The old MDT text commands have been remapped as follows (note all of these can be achieved in the menus);
    + "minimap mdt <category>" - turns a given category on or off, eg "minimap mdt loot"
    + "minimap mdt <enable/disable>" - turns map door text parsing on or off
    + "minimap mdt limit <score>" - hide rooms who's total score falls below this limit.
 -- All user MDT matches are stored in your user-database file (along with your bookmarks, settings, and such), and so will not be lost between updates, as long as this file is never deleted by you.
 -- MDT matches can be set to match on a specific colour rather than a string - this could be your "options colour playerkiller" colour, to automatically score all playerkillers highly (likewise "options colour groupmember|player" colours).
 -- Multiple categories can now be enabled or disabled, instead of only one at a time or none, either from the right-click menus or with the new MDT commands (see above).
 -- MDT filters can now be limited to specific map-zones, or set to global/always-on, for example to allow DJB Palace Guards to highlight, but not Ankh-Morpork Palace Guards (this is already a default filter).
 -- The fully parsed output when typing "map door text" now maintains any playername colours sent by the Discworld, and will also update your written-map window when done to fill it with the longer-range.
 -- The default filters provided by the CowBar are improved on the old list, and also include a "letters" category for dead-letter missions (disabled by default) containing most of the "Distant Land" wandering NPCs highlighted and scored. (enable this list easily with "minimap mdt letters").  You can add any others yourself very easily.
 -- You can easily restore the CowBar default filters from the menus, in case you delete them/over-ride them, but this will still preserve any custom matches you may have added too, it will only restore/replace the default filters.
 -- After many user requests, you can force the written-map page to word-wrap lines to see everything in a room, but this is not recommended (harder to see at a quick glance when hunting high-scoring rooms, much more intense than the non-wrapped output CPU wise).
* Various new obscure items, locations, NPCs, a few new player houses in Ephebe, and other minor changes/additions to the databases or map graphics.
* A new menu option allows some primitive, and not recommended, simple re-colouring of some core Cow Bar colours, by right clicking the main graphical minimap window and going to the "CowBar Colours..." sub-menu.  It is NOT recommended you change these, and currently not everything that should be re-colourable, is re-colourable.  There is an option at the top of that menu to reset all the colours back to default.  This was a user-request, there may or may not be further options to change colours of other elements in the future.


======================================
v3.80 Cow Bar Update, March 17th 2019:
======================================
* A new map has been created for the Ephebe Citadel, the old citadel rooms have been moved from the main Ephebe map to this new map, and the new Citadel (60 or so new rooms) has been added in.  Ephebe and the Ephebe underdocks maps have been updated.  New locations, NPCs, items, rooms etc. have all been put into the databases.
* Two new item-searching commands have been added to search items by the description texts or the appraisal texts;
  "minimap description <text>" will search for any items that have a description stored containing the text.
  "minimap appraise <text>" will search for any items that have an appraisal stored containing the text.
* Searching the item database for an EXACT, single item can be achieved with quotation marks around the item name, for example; minimap item "doughnut"  will only return the item literally named "doughnut", not the other 12+ items with doughnut somewhere in the item name.
* Typing "minimap <number>" or "minimap place <number>" will bring up room details for a given search result, which can let you bring up a full shoplist easily from a search, for example search "minimap shop doughnut" to find a shop selling a doughnut, then type "minimap place 5" to bring up the full room/shop details of the doughnut-search result number 5.
* New text command "minimap gpregen <0-5>" has been added to change the CURRENT combat-set's GP regen rate (you can still change it from the right-click menu of the HP/GP/Burden bar window, and the combat-stats window, too).
* New text command "minimap clearstatset" will wipe to 0 your current stat-sets WITH NO CONFIRMATION - just an instant clearance of all your current combat-stats on the set you are currently on.  Use with caution - intended for people regularly testing/clearing their stats.
* Text command "minimap statset <statset-name>" will now work as expected if a matching stat-set is found to switch to, rather than crashing the plugin.  "minimap statset <id/number>" will still switch to the appropriate stat set (from 1-100), too.
* New command "routenpc" added - if you search the NPC database, for example "minimap npc bessie", and then type "minimap routenpc 1" you can try to speedwalk to the NPC result-number 1, if a route is possible.
* A few various missing/obscure NPCs, items, rooms added to the databases.


=========================================
v3.70 Cow Bar Update, November 10th 2018:
=========================================
* New Copperhead map (within the Ramtops region) added to the database, includes new graphic in the /maps/ folder, and updates to the database files for locations, NPCs, items etc., plus a small mining-related graphic to show when going down into the mines.
* On the new Discworld terrains map, you can now shift-click MOST key/important locations (usually the text) that have corresponding maps, to be taken into that map (eg shift-click on "AM" or the big red circle for AM, and get taken to the AM map defaulting at the Drum), for quick navigation to other maps when on the terrains map.
* I have apparently had Scrogden named wrong in my head for 20 years (and throughout the plugin for the past couple).  Scrogden.  Scrogden.  Scrodgen.  Scrodgen.  Scrogglewoggle.  The terrains map, and the "shortcut search" locations, now have the correct spelling.
* Running into a room that is too dark to receive data for (get a light, seriously!) will now try and NOT default to treating it as a terrain room (for example running along docks in AM where rooms are technically terrain).  This might have unexpected effects in pitch-blackness out in the actual terrains, but it is very hard to handle "darkness" properly when the Disc is not sending information about your location, so generally I recommend everyone to get a torch, a GP-ring, a miner's helmet, a lantern, a permalight, magical lights, whatever you can!
* Cow Bar now has a new option from right clicking the main graphical minimap "Attempt Auto-Wrap Output".  This is ENABLED by default on the full portable MUSHclient package, but disabled for anyone upgrading/manually installing.  This option will try to auto-enable MUSHclient word-wrapping and try to auto-adjust it based on your mud-output-area width whenever your screen changes.  This is largely to help new users who often want to sort their wrapping out and struggle to find how (or know whether to do it Disc or client side!).
* Right-clicking the XP window has a new sub-menu "XP Graph Scaling", where you can pick Auto-Scaling (default), or you can lock your xp-rate graph to a MAXIMUM of either 100k, 200k, 500k, 800k, 1m or even 2m.  The graph will never auto-scale down/up based on your live XP rates if you pick any of these new fixed options.
* The shields/group window now has a new option "Self-Solo Shields Only" option in it's right-click menu, to force the shields window to ONLY show your own shields, not those of your group members, for people with very low screen real-estate (or lack of conscience for others!).
* The combat stats window sub-menus for "Re-Colour MUD Combat Texts..." and "Hide MUD Combat Texts..." now have options at the top of each to tick/enable ALL categories of message-type, or untick/disable ALL categories of message-type, in one click (for example, to disable all of the Cow Bar's re-colouring of combat in one go).
* The text note given when changing the "Allow map to move through unsupported exits" option on/off was the wrong way around, now it's not (and it also now hints that setting this option to on, is NOT recommended for the average user!).
* A number of new (generally obscure) NPC/Shop/Location additions to the internal databases/maps etc. 
* Talker/Club names with the ampersand & symbol in their names should now be handled by the comms window (you will need to stop recording/delete any previous attempts to record such club names, and re-record them from scratch with the new version).


=============================================
v3.60 "Explorer's Edition" October 12th 2018:
=============================================
* New Explorer's Edition of the Cow Bar adds a whole new giant unified terrains map, compiled by Quow, showing the entire Disc terrains from Klatch to Agatea all in a single 1:1 scale;
 -- New disc terrain map is a 1 pixel = 1 room image, which can show your location anywhere on the Disc, within skills-based limits.
 -- Thanks to a new update Disc-side, the Cow Bar can now read your ROUGH location in the terrains, wherever you may be in them...
 -- Your character's abilities dictates the accuracy:
    + A new character with no adventuring skills will find this feature useless, with the map completely wrong in the wilds.
    + Somebody with a few skills under their belt may find it gives a useful rough region of the Disc they are in.  
    + The higher your skills, the better you are able to read maps, the more accurate your maps will be no matter where you go!
 -- You can manually adjust your position in the terrain map if you think you know better where you are, by ctrl-clicking where you think you really are on the map (note, this this "adjustment" loses accuracy after a short timespan, again skills-based, so you may have to keep re-adjusting with low skills)
 -- There is a toggle-option to disable attempts to track you around the wilds of the terrain for people with no skills at all that find the feature too annoying/useless at their skills, by right-clicking the graphical minimap, going to "Minimap Options..." and disabling "Attempt Terrains Tracking".
 -- Any locations that are part of the Cow Bar's speedwalks, for example journeying along roads for between towns across the Disc, will show your precise location as you speedwalk through the land, but if you manually stray from these paths you can get "lost" again based on your skills.
 -- The terrains map was built from many months of database-created ascii maps wandering around converted into imagery with some code, overlayed over to update and fix up previously released "public" terrain maps (incomplete and out of date) over the decades by the likes of Pinkfish, Ruin and Bluius.
* Hotspots window has new option "Show Notifications in Comms Window" which will cause any hotspot notifications texts to ALSO be sent to your comms window (treated as a tell for filtering purposes).
* Shield break colourings - Group and Shields window sub-menu option "Shield Event Alerts..." now lets you pick re-colourings for all the shield-break events, along with the sound alerts added in the previous update.  So you can now re-colour all the shield events you want without having to create your own secondary set of shield-trigger texts!  Note that for "group" breaks, the re-colouring applies to ANYONE seen with shields-breaking, due to the way colour triggers work and to keep things fast/simple, but sound-events for group shields will only play for people listed as a group member.
* When using the {area} filters for shop, NPC, or location searches, Cow Bar will try to apply some sense to the general regions and what maps should count as within that area, for example now if you search "minimap npc {am}nicolette" Nicolette in the Thieves guild map will show up as a result, instead of requiring you to specify thieves as an area filter.
* Ability to enable/show a crosshair overlay on the graphical map highlighting your position, for people that struggle to see their location (matches map-dot colour choice).  Note that your "current/clicked/tracked" location is always at the very centre of your map window, regardless of these choices (Note: if you are on the new terrain overview map, enabling crosshair mode will disable the central dot and show a narrower crosshair, to help you see exactly what is beneath the crosshair).
* New higher zoom level 400% added ("minimap zoom 7").
* The "XP Gain Notification Text" (from right-clicking the XP miniwindow) now has a new sub-menu to select the XP amount needed to trigger the notifications, with options for 10+, 100+, 500+, 1000+ or 5000+ xp needed to trigger (default is 1000+).  Note very low limits can be very spammy, and are more for people trying to study exact xp-gains from things than general use.
* Some of the toggle-options in "Minimap Options" in the graphical minimap right-click menu now give textual output and descriptions of what they do when enabling/disabling them.
* Minor bugs in manually switching maps type above a certain map-number fixed, so you can now switch between all maps easily from the "Switch To Map" menu option, or by alt-left clicking or alt-right clicking the graphical map window.
* Optimisations done to some heavier functions called very often, such as vitals window not doing a full "graphical redraw" if no values have changes, pre-compiled lookup lists of colour valuations for some calculations, and some others throughout.


========================
v3.51 September 22 2018:
========================
* Two new "Instant Layouts" are now available to pick from the right-click menus, "Side of Beef Left" and "Side of Beef Right".  These new layouts are effectively a "split-screen", with one half for your MUD output and chat window, the other half for all the Cow Bar windows neatly packed in.
* Temple of Patina in Ephebe updated with new rooms and shops.
* Graphical minimap auto-unhides if you click any "Show" links on search results etc. and it was previously hidden.
* Option of Hotspots window right-click menu to "prioritise" timer display redraws on-screen, this can reset any timer issues and help slight display issues on some machines.

============================================
v3.5 "Tree Fiddy Edition" September 20 2018:
============================================
* Entirely new module, "Hotspots", added to the Cow Bar (disabled by default), for fully customisable hotspot timers to be used for hotspots, NPC kills, shop-stealing visitations, mission/achievement grindings, animal sacrifices or anything else you can think of, with full abilities to share your timers with others, sync times with group members etc. - Full details, commands, features at end of this changelog.
* Medina interior map has been created and added.  It can not and will not ever tell you which directions are connecting which rooms, but it will help you know your current position as you move around, and update the map correctly when you enter the Medina from elsewhere on the Disc.
* Shield Break Sounds - the Shields and Group window now allows users, via the right click menu, to enable sounds simply and easily for shield-break events for yourself, or group members, for all five of the supported shield types (TPA, CCC, EFF, BUG, MS).  The system for playing sounds is different to the one built into MUSHclient, as it preloads all sounds into memory and keeps them ready to play, instantly, rather than loading from hard-drive each time it needs to play. This allows people uncomfortable with MUSHclient's trigger system to quickly and easily use sounds for their shield breaks, letting the Cow Bars built-in shield triggers handle everything.  Note that Quow is NOT responsible for any shield-break events you may miss when using this new system!
* New "HP Low" notification system in the HP/GP Vitals bare window menu options.  Select a soundfile and enabling this option will cause the Cow Bar to play your selected sound if a HP update is received that shows your HP to be at 30% (or lower).  Once played, it will not play again until your HP has recovered back to at least 90+%, after which the sound can be played once more if you drop low enough again.
* GP Notification sound system, for GP re-filling after dropping below 75%, has been updated to the new play sound from memory system.  GP Notification sounds can be enabled/selected by right-clicking the HP/GP vitals miniwindow.
* Updated street names in database for various streets around AM with more descriptive [shortinlong] room names.
* Igorina in Ephebe on Petulia avenue added to graphical map/databases.
* A number of deep behind-the-scenes core code changes to window, layout, module handling and more (fixes some rare oddities, optimises a number of things).
* Speedwalk routefinding direct to NPCs or specific item/room searches now always takes you to the final/correct room in cases where multiple rooms share the same exact visual map co-ordinations/room on the graphical maps.
* "KII" references renamed to "BUG" for witch bug shields throughout the plugin ("Mama Kolydina's Instant Infestation").
* Tweaked some of the default layouts to format slightly better on certain resolutions and with the new Hotspots window.
* Many changes to how parts of the plugin works to support the ability to use LuaJIT or newer versions of LUA in the future, instead of being stuck with MUSHclient's default LUA, for advanced users to take advantage of.
* Various minor tweaks/additions/fixes in some maps and database item/NPC/location objects.
* New hotspots module, disabled by default, can be enabled by right clicking your graphical minimap window and go to "Disable/Enable Modules..." to enable it and to start adding your own hotspots. This is a module useful for hunters as a way to keep tabs on all of the various places they like to hunt and to remember where they've been or not recently, but can also be used for any other purposes, for example keep track on all your shoplifting target locations and when you last rotated through them, or activities relating to achievements quests or missions, or anything else you can think of.  You can export and share your timers with others, and synchronise your times with group-members to assist when changing leaders and continue.  Some of the features include:
  - New hotspots window lists all of your hotspots ordered from ones visited most recently (least important/can scroll off the top of the window), to ones visited longest ago (most important/bottom of the window).
  - Add a new "hotspot" - give it a short/unique name, pick a room on the map or your current room, or enter a fully custom MUSHclient trigger, either a standard basic trigger, or advanced RegEx trigger.  Decide when and how the hotspot timer resets.
  - Add optional extra reminder-notifications which will send a reminder to your main MUD output if you haven't visited the hotspot in X minutes - these will work even if the hotspots window is hidden (but not if the entire module is disabled)
  - Optionally set a special colour for any already-created hotspots, to highlight different hotspots in the hotspot window list.
  - Export all of your hotspots to the clipboard, for saving locally, or sharing with others through pastebin sites, tells, group chat etc.
  - Import hotspots allows you to import a set of hotspots as a long string, overwriting or adding to your own hotspots, for example from a group member willing to share all of their personal hunting spots.
  - Delete a hotspot if you decide you don't like how you set it up/aren't interested in it after importing from others.
  - Manually reset a hotspot timer with a couple of clicks or with the new command "minimap hotspot <hotspot name>".
  - Group Sync shares a list of your hotspot names and times-last-visited with your group - any group members with the hotspot timers module enabled will find any hotspots they have which share the same names, auto-syncing to your times.
  - New related text commands:
    "minimap group hotspots" (share-to-sync your current hotspot timers with group members)
    "minimap hotspots" (text output in mud area of all hotspots with current times, ordered by oldest to most recent visit)
    "minimap hotspot <hotspot name>" (reset the time for this hotspot)

=======================
v3.1 September 03 2018:
=======================
* Alignment - Tickable option in the HP/GP/Burden window to show your alignment (off by default).
* Contemplating spells as a wizzard should set your current GP to 0 when you emerge from the trance.
* Text command for deleting bookmarks added, "minimap delete bookmark <bookmark name>", can be partial or full matching the bookmark name, similar to the "minimap route <bookmark name>" command.
* Graphical map centre-dot colour can now be changed from right-clicking the map window, going to Minimap Options, and selecting "Colour Select Map Centre-Dot".  Default is still red.
* Embalming guild in DJB now fully mapped with it's own interior-map on the DJB graphical map, NPCs and shop in database etc.
* "Monolith" marked on Klatchian map for general location and added to room database.
* Combat messages for new Urumi weapons added for combat-stat support.
* "Omit from main output" options for talker/club channels now activates correctly between plugin restarts.
* Copy "all" messages to clipboard limited to maximum of last 1000 messages to help prevent out-of-memory issues.
* Rare crash-chance when resizing chat window and clicking a chat-panel fixed.
* Stopping recording a channel now deletes the triggers fully to allow re-adding the same channel immediately after without needing to restart the plugin.
* Minor additions to possible witch bug-shield text recognitions.

=======================
v3.0 May 06 2018:
=======================
* Whole new NPC and Item database - over 9,000 items and 2,600 NPCs in an instant, searchable database built entirely from scratch, with many new commands for navigating and searching them;
 - "minimap item <item>" now works differently - this searches items and doesn't give shops directly.  It also searches for items seen on NPCs (see new NPC database update below).  Clicking on an item (or typing "minimap item <result number>") gives you that item's detailed info (if it has any) such as description, appraise, rough-weight, and lists any shops or NPCs that might sell it, or NPCs it has been seen on.
 - "minimap shop <item>" works like the old item search used to - simply lists all shops with route links to them, for any shop that sells any item that might match your search.
* New NPC database - has many (most) NPCs that are found throughout the mapped-regions of the Disc (cities, towns, villages, shops) including their visible (when looked at) inventories and any items they sell (many NPCs have been hunted to gather their undergarment inventories too!).
 - "minimap npc <npc>" searches the new NPC database and lists any matching NPCs along with the map regions they are found in.  Clicking an NPC gives details such as last-seen location, known inventory and sale lists (and prices).
* Ability to limit location, shop, and NPC searches to a region using curly-bracers, eg "minimap {am} drum", "minimap npc {bp} nobleman", "minimap shop {sto-lat} large metal shield".
* Search results are now ordered alphabetically, and formatted slightly better.
* Item database can now handle NPC inventories, NPCs that sell items, restaurants, and shops with rotating stocks (no more stock-code storage).
* Many (definitely not all!) herbs/vegetables that are gatherable have been added in to various gardens/locations, as a shop item with the price of "gather".
* Using the "Show Clicked Room Info" after selecting a room on the map (or using the command "minimap roominfo") will now also show any NPCs that had been recorded/seen in that room.
* All searches that return numbered clickable searches can also be accessed with text commands, eg "minimap item 7" to get details on the 7th item in a list, or "minimap npc 4" for the 4th NPC.
* Zooming of graphical map now possible - either ctrl-middle wheel scroll the graphical map window, or use the new command "minimap zoom [1-6]", or right click the graphical map window, go to "Minimap Options" and select the zoom options.
* Mouse-wheel scrolling while hovering over the communication window will now scroll lines up/down.
* Either double-clicking the main chat area of the communication window, or the command "minimap chat", will enlarge (or re-shrink) the chat area to allow temporary easier reading back of many messages.
* You can now create whole new stat sets, and delete stat sets, along with having up to 100 different stat sets (only 5 are created by default still), for combat stat tracking/alts.
* New command "minimap statset <number>" (eg "minimap statset 12") will switch to stat set number 12.  If it doesn't exist, it will be created.  This can be used for client-side macros/aliases to quickly switch or create sets.
* External/third party addon plugins can call the new functions CombatSetSwitchToName(StatSetName) or CombatSetSwitchToID(StatSetID) within the CowBar for instant/seamless stat set creation and switching;
   - If a name is given, but no stat set exists with that name, one is automatically created (if there are less than 100 total stat sets) and switched to.
   - These are for people to develop their own plugins/trigger sets for with automated stat switchings, for example to switch based on NPC names attacked (and auto-creating sets for different NPC types) or for weapon types etc.
* A new option has been added to the HP/GP/Burden bar window menu - "Show GP Loss Notification Texts" - similar to HP loss notifications, any drops detected by the plugin are reported, coloured to match GP bar colours.
   - Note, only GP drops of -6 or greater are reported, to minimise issues of the auto-GP regen calculations not matching Disc-side regen and spamming GP loss notices.
* Four new commands for menu-based options for mouse-free play/macro'ing;  "minimap group xp", "minimap group kills" and "minimap group reset" to group-chat your xp rate, kill stats, or to force reset and refresh group members/statuses, and "minimap xp reset" to reset your current XP rates/graph to 0 (eg for starting a new hunting session, alt-switching, etc.).
* You can now force a location/place search by adding the word "place" before your usual search, for example "minimap place item" to search for room-names containing the word "item", instead of activating the item search.
* If used with the new Mission Helper plugin v0.6 or higher, the CowBar will pass character login names to the mission helper and allow for separate mission timers for each character you switch to.
* New graphical map created for Skund Forest Wolf Trail, and all database links inserted with connections to the two terrain roads (one east of Pekan Ford, one near the dog house).
* Haunted mansion interior and Five Ways bell tower interior added to AM buildings graphical and database maps.
* Interior of the Hammered Cat bar/restaurant and games rooms added to the graphical and database map of Academy of Artificers (AoA, Sto-lat).
* Interiors for the manor house and the mansion added to Sto-lat graphical map.
* Druid Compound and shop, newbie museum, and some Assassin and Thief related areas, added to various parts of the Ramtops graphical and database maps.
* New interiors detailed on the Genua graphical map - offices of pizzeria, stables, casino, the Tacticus Academy and the Hotel.
* Ephebe map updated and modified - new interior graphics for temples, lighthouse and bar building, and terrain roads removed from the city map (these already exist on the Klatch region map).
* Temple interiors added to DJB graphical maps.
* Sunken ship, sewers, and partial underdock of fish market added to BP graphical map.
* Physical route to and from the PK Arena now possible with speedwalking alone.
* PK arena location shifted on the graphical Klatch region map.
* New "special places" map for misc places that don't have any other completely suitable place.  Includes walking cottage, rat maze, L-Space, and the travelling stalls in the Sto region.
* Detection of initial hut in pumpkin town when creating a brand new character, and some clickable links automatically given to help set up initial Disc options and terminal settings for each new character.
* When in the UU Library, the graphical map titlebar now tells you the thaum level you are at.
* Entering "turn around", "turn left" and "turn right" while in the UU Library will now attempt to re-align the positional arrow.
* Better L-Space detection/handling, plus a new little graphic on the map for when you get lost in L-Space.
* Shortcut-link (shift-left-click) points added to most of the up/down ladder points between western AM and the main dock roads beneath.
* Most player houses have had their entrance garden/hall/room (first room only) added to database with correct graphical map locations, to allow easier bookmarking/speedwalking into or out of player houses.
* All shops and buildings have had their positions shifted to more closely match the graphical maps (shops are often connected by a shorter distance than normal streets).
* Fixed issue with club/channel talker names with hiephens in their names between client restarts.
* Many other minor additions, changes, updates, fixes and tweaks throughout the graphical maps, the database maps and the plugin - be sure to update ALL the files in the /maps/ folder!

v2.13:
=====================
* Bookmarks as seen in "minimap bookmarks" should now be sorted alphabetically for people with large bookmark lists.

=====================
v2.12:
=====================
* Searching for map locations or items with the 'minimap <place>' or 'minimap item <item>' now numbers the results, these numbers can then be used by the route command.
* Typing 'minimap route <number>' will look for and immediately start running a speedwalk to the correlating numbered results from the last place or item search command you did.
* The above two changes should allow screenreader users to use the speedwalking and location searching functions completely with text and typing commands alone.
* Further minor updates to out of the way locations to the room database.

=====================
v2.11:
=====================
* New command added; "minimap route <bookmark>" will instantly try to route to any bookmark you have created - supports full or partial match (for example if you had a bookmark named "My Lovely Home", you could "minimap route home"). Type "minimap bookmarks" to list/edit bookmarks. Use the menus on the graphical map to set bookmarks (left click a room on the map, then use the right-click menus to create a bookmark there), or type "minimap bookmark" to create a bookmark at the room you are currently stood in.

=====================
v2.10:
=====================
* Added a new Instant Layout "Simple Cow" that is now the default layout on new installs. This is a simpler layout with combat-stats and shields windows hidden, mainly aimed at new players. Change layouts any time by right clicking any miniwindow and going to the "Instant Layouts" sub-menu.
* Added default built-in support for special channels (such as the newbie channel) that work differently to normal talker channels.

=====================
v2.09:
=====================
* Added command "minimap discworldconfig" to re-configure Discworld-side settings to help fix any oddities caused by certain settings.

* Some more obscure combat-text triggers added.

=====================
v2.07:
=====================
* Attempts to detect wrong term type (causes issues for new characters) and gives clickable link to correct this (by sending "term ansi" them "term network" to the MUD).
* Auto-correction of errors for miniwindows that become corrupted (below-0 size) on plugin launch.
* Added ability for third-party plugins to send messages to the communications window with external function calls (sample plugins to be made public later).

=====================
v2.06:
=====================

* More unusual terrain-room-names added for the hide-in-terrain feature to recognise.
* Further rare/unusual combat texts added to the combat trigger sets.
* Minor error-checks in to help locate some rare errors from using older MUSHclient versions.

=====================
v2.051:
=====================
* Update for WINE MUSHclient users only - ignores MUSHclient window redraw requests on program load, helps prevent program freezing on startup with plugin installed.
v2.05:
* When searching for items with "minimap item <itemname>", if nothing is found, a clickable link to search for the item on Kefka's database is displayed.
* Comms window right click menu now has a "Font Options" sub-menu, with a small variety of fonts and font-sizes. This also affects the written map and ascii map windows.

* Better handling of unusual playername capitalising/casing in groups.
* Some missing combat related texts added to the combat trigger sets/colours.
* Minor changes to handling of HP/XP notification queues.

* Some more uncommon combat texts added to the combat trigger sets.
* Minor map database updates/additions for some out-of-the-way buildings.

=====================
v2.03 - MDT updated to v0.04:
=====================
* The MDT (map-door-text/written-map) plugin included with the Cow Bar has been updated to v0.04, to fix a crash bug in certain terrain rooms. You can update just the MDT plugin rather than the whole Cow Bar.
v2.03:
* Combat text lines are no longer re-coloured if the combat stats module is fully disabled.
* Can no longer drag-move windows with the right-mouse-button, must use the left-mouse-button, to prevent accidental moving when accessing menus.
* Burden bars should now be updated immediately after dropping/holding items or changing your burden, rather than a command later.
* Group members leaving should now be removed from the group shields window without needing a "group status/group shields" forced update.
* In group stats and shields systems, playernames will have their first character force-capitalised, to get around issues with the MUD sometimes capitalising names and sometimes not.
* Defending shoves and trips no longer adds to the total "defended hits" statistic, only defended specials statistic.
* The XP graph/chart is now only redrawn once a minute/when the window is resized, not every single time your current XP total is updated.
* Talker channels with a hyphen should now record properly into the comms window (eg "Ankh-MorporkCouncil").
* Fixed issues with ASCII window auto-hiding-showing when in/out of terrains option problems.

=====================
v2.02:
=====================
* Fixed runtimes on certain Discworld date days.

=====================
v2.01:
=====================
* Communications window now allows you to modify names and channels for any custom chat-tab, rather than have to delete and re-create them.
* "Group Say/Chat" messages now get recorded into the communications window correctly.
* Some defended unarmed kick attacks were not being tracked/coloured/filtered.
* If you have "verbose htell", "hcomm" won't put [say] [soul] or [tell] events into the group comms log.

==============================
v2.00 "Cow Bar" Major Release:
==============================
Minimap Changes:
* From v2.00 onwards, your bookmarks are stored in a separate file, so you will not lose bookmarks when you update the plugin in future.
* You can now "Rename" a room via bookmarks.  List your bookmarks in "minimap bookmarks" and select Rename.  The new name will appear anywhere the room name normally would, and can be searched for.
* The minimap brightness can be reduced (and made up to 50% darker) with the command "minimap brightness <50-100>", eg "minimap brightness 90", or from the minimap options sub-menu.
* You can now resize the minimap window by click-dragging the left, bottom, or right edges (or corners) of the minimap window.
* The current Discworld date and time is shown in the bottom of the minimap window - this can be switched off in the right-click minimap options menu.
* Various additions/changes to minimap location database and graphical maps.  Be sure to replace any old files.
* Minimap broadcasts a "Map ID" to any other plugins that want to use "OnPluginBroadcast", to easily discover the map the user is on - for example, to easily make a plugin that plays ambient background sounds based on the map region.

Seven New Windows/Modules:
* Seven new fully customisable modules/windows have been added:  Vitals Bars, XP Rate, Shield/Group Window, Combat Stats, Ascii Map, Written Map, and Communications.
* Every window has it's own right-click menu, with various options, features, and customisations unique to that window available in each.
* Each new optional module can be fully disabled by right-clicking on the main minimap window (the "master window") and going into the "Disable/Enable Modules" sub-menu.  A disabled module will remove the window, and prevent all triggers and functions relating to that module from working.

Screen Margins & Custom UI:
* Whole new UI system allows you to quickly set up screen area "margins" (top, left, right, bottom, any combination or none), by dragging each edge with your mouse to make room for the new UI windows/modules.
* Right click any miniwindow, and in the "Screen Margins" sub-menu, unlock the margins to allow you to drag the white lines marking your margin regions, then re-lock once satisfied.  Select which margins to enable in the menus.
* Nine pre-configured layouts for all windows, margins, their sizes and positions, can be found in the right-click "Instant Layouts" sub-menu to quickly lay out the windows neatly.
* You can also save, and load, a tenth "Custom Cows" layout to quickly go back to a specific fully custom layout you made yourself.
* All new miniwindows can be moved by click-dragging the windows around.  They can all be resized by dragging the edges or corners of their windows (except the top edges).  They can be positioned anywhere in the world window.
* All miniwindows have an option in their individual right-click menus to "Lock" their position - this will prevent accidental dragging, or resizing, until they are unlocked.

Communications Window:
* This tabbed comms window can record all tells, group chats, and any talker or club channels you add.
* You can tab between different channels to quickly see different messages, or click "All" to see everything.
* The chat tabs along the top are fully customisable - you can delete the default tabs, and create your own tabs, giving them custom names, and picking what each tab shows (for example, a tab for tells and group chat only, or a tab called "Priests" for every different type of Priest talker if you have multiple priest alts).
* Talker, club and group messages can be hidden/omitted from the main MUD output window, if you only wish for them to appear in the new chat window.
* Right click on a line and select to copy the line from the menu to copy it to your clipboard, or you can select to copy all communications from the current tab to your clipboard in one go.

Character Vitals:
* New Window:  Character Vitals (HP, GP, Burden) are now displayed in a new vitals window.  This can be stretched/shrunk/positioned anywhere.
* Right-click the character vitals window to set the automatic GP regeneration rates (tied to combat sets - see below).
* Bars can be stacked vertically, or horizontally.
* There are "GP Full Notification" options - this allows you to pick a soundfile (there are a few included in the /maps/ folder), that will be played when your GP reaches full again IF your GP had previously dropped to 75% or lower.
* "Show HP Loss Notification Texts" can add a line to your MUD output highlighting any and all HP drops clearly.

XP Rate/Monitor:
* This is an automatic graph and set of data showing your xp/hour rates, and xp earned total since startup/last reset by you.
* The XP graph will automatically scale and size, and adjust the value-scaling based on your maximum xp-rate over the last 60 minutes.
* Right click the xp window for options to reset the current values, or send current xp-per-hour and xp-earning rates to group chat.
* "Show XP Report" option will show a report detailing total XP rate since you last reset, along with your current hour's XP rate.
* "Show XP Gain Notification Texts" can add a line to your MUD output highlighting any and all XP gains over 1,000 clearly.

Shields/Group Monitor:
* This window will keep track of your own shields in a simple on/off manner, plus those for any group members if you are grouped.
* Right click the shields/group window for options to reset the current group members and shields, or to check your personal shield status.
* Group kills and kills-per-hour reports can be generated for all currently grouped members - either privately to you, or in a shorter form sent to group chat.

Combat Stats & Combat Texts:
* Provides ability to uniquely colour every type of combat message - from incoming special hits that land, to seeing third parties kill eachother, to enemies defending your outgoing base round hits.
* Along with the ability to colour every type of line, you can also omit/hide, every type of line - for example, hide all incoming hits which you successfully defend - the stats will still be recorded, but you won't see the spam.
* Monitors various combat-related stats - kills per round, hits per round, incoming and outgoing specials, hits, defenses, broken down by defense types, shield types, and skill of the defense.
* You can switch between five different sets of combat stats that are all saved to file individually, and rename each set, from the right-click menu on the combat stats window.  For example to have different sets for different alts, or try out a whole new weapon type without interfering with your main stats.
* Any combat set named after your character will be automatically swithced to if you have "inform logon" set in Discworld options, including associated GP regen rates.
(you could also add "frimble [<character name> enters Discworld]" to your "alias login" if you don't want to enable login informs, to achieve the automatic switching)
* A full detailed "Combat Stats Report" can be generated from the right-click menu of the stats window, breaking down into much greater detail the combat stats than is visible in the window.
* "Optimise Plugin Combat Triggers" will optionally set your Discworld MUD colour option to set combat texts to bright yellow - this allows the plugin to optimise the triggers to only read yellow lines, and not be triggered by souls and remotes that might look like combat text.  You should not see any yellow texts yourself, if you are using the plugin's combat colour options.  Be sure to set your combat texts for all alts to yellow, too, if you use this feature.

Live Written Map:
* This displays a live "written map" each time you enter a room - this is a shorter-range version of what you see if you manually perform the "map door text" command.  It is identical to using the option "options output map written=on", but the plugin does not prevent the Ascii map from also being visible.
* If Quow's Map-Door-Text plugin v0.03+ is also installed and enabled, which is included the CowBar 2.0 archive file, then you will see the parsed written map text output in this window, complete with your room scoring limits and colours, which you can configure by editing the map door text .xml file.

Ascii Map:
* This will show a copy of the Ascii map as sent by the MUD for every room, centred on your position.
* You can "Omit/Hide" the map from the MUD output, to reduce screen spam, and have your Ascii map ONLY in this window.
* You can set the Ascii map to automatically Hide/Show with terrains - this will cause it to hide when you are in a recognised or non-terrain room, and show itself when you enter terrains.  Used in conjunction with the graphical minimap "Auto Hide in terrains" options, and if you position both windows in the same location, means you can have an alternation between a graphical and an Ascii map depending on where you are.



=====================
v1.04:
=====================
* Slippery Hollow map graphics and database entries added.

=====================
v1.03:
=====================
* QuowMapPath can be left blank (and is blank by default in code) - it will automatically try to find /maps/ folder in same location as the plugin file.
* If you do not keep your /maps/ folder in the same location as the plugin.xml file, you can (and must) still manually edit QuowMapPath in the .xml code.
* Fixed various errors for certain settings causing the UU Library map not to work as expected, much more robust even when entering wrong directions by mistake.

=====================
v1.02:
=====================
* Correctly show the minimap again when leaving terrains if auto-hide in terrains is enabled.
* Added new special T-Shop map graphic and location into the database.
* Improved handling when entering the UU Library.

* Improved handling on long movement queues leading to blockages.
* Extra route-pathing data around the centre of the TOSG.
* Fixed pathing from north/east DJB to Ephebe or beyond if options personal travel is set to journey.

=====================
v1.01:
=====================
* Removed debug text appearing when following another player.
* Added speedwalk pathing to/from poison labs in AM Assassins Guild.
* You may bookmark the room your character is currently stood in by typing "minimap bookmark", instead of needing to click on your room and use the menu.

=====================
v1.00:
=====================
* Initial Release of the newly overhauled speedwalk/GPS edition of the minimap.
